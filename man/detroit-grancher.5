.
.SH "NAME"
\fBdetroit\-grancher\fR \- publish website via dedicated git branch
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The Grancher tool utilizes the Grancher library to publish a project\'s website via a dedicated git branch\. Typically this is the \fBgh\-pages\fR branch\.
.
.P
Note that his plug\-in has been generally superseded by the \fBgithub\fR plug\-in\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
The following options can be used in Detroit assembly files for defining a github service\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBremote\fR \- The remote to use (defaults to \'origin\')\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBbranch\fR \- The branch into which to save the files\. Defaults to \fBgh\-pages\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBkeep\fR \- List of any files/directory to not overwrite in branch\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBkeep_all\fR \- Do not remove any files currently in the branch\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBsitemap\fR \- List of directories and files to transfer\. If a single directory entry is given then the contents of that directory will be transferred\. Defaults to \fBsite\fR, \fBwebsite\fR or \fBdoc\fR\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
If you keep your website in a project sub\-directory called either \fBsite\fR, \fBweb\fR, \fBwebsite\fR or \fBwww\fR, and failing those, \fBdoc\fR or \fBdocs\fR, then the defaults settings are likely sufficient\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

grancher:
  active: true
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If the files to copy to the gh\-pages branch are more entailed, use a mapping of source to destination\. For example, if we want to copy all the files in \fBsite/\fR to gh\-pages, but also all the files in \fBdoc/\fR to a directory called \fBdoc\fR we could use:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

grancher:
  sitemap:
    site: \.
    doc: doc
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
However, this isn\'t usually necessary, since a soft link could be used instead\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ ln \-s doc site/doc
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
You can check soft\-links into with git and they will be transferred as if the real file when copied to the gh\-pages file\. So a more complex \fBsitemap\fR is really only needed when more specific selections or complex globs are needed\.
